# Simulated Drum Kit 
A small practice project that features a simulated drum kit. This web page allows users to play drums by pressing keyboard keys or by clicking on the drum buttons displayed on the screen. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it's a fun way to explore audio interaction in web development.

Feel free to check it out and maybe even try some beats!
